## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<section class="courseCreator">
  <img src="./assets/images/image-avatar.webp" alt="Greg Hooper" />
  <p>Greg Hooper</p>
</section>
```

```css
.courseCreator img {
  width: 32px;
  height: 32px;
  justify-content: center;
  margin-right: 5px;
}
.courseCreator p {
  font-weight: 800;
  font-size: 1rem;
  align-self: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I definitely want to know as much about CSS Flexbox and Grid, JavaScript, React.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Matic Box Shadow Generator](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - This helped me get the box shadow just right on the container.
- [HTMLColors.com](https://htmlcolors.com/hsl-to-hex) - I am not fond of using HSL color values. I would much rather use hexidecimal values.
